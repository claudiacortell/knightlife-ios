        BlockMetas are what are used under settings under 'Block Configuration'
            aka the extras. activites, x block, assembly, free, class meeting, you get the idea.
        There are courses (abcdefg) and there are the 'extras' which are the BlockMetas
     
     variables
        - block: BlockMetaID
            the ID for the BlockMeta created
        - color: UIColor
        - beforeClassNotifications: Bool
            bool because toggle notifications in settings
        - afterClassNotifications: Bool
            ^^^^
        - customName: String?
            so I'm pretty sure this is 'String?' because only 'free' out of the BlockMetas gives an option for a custom name in settings.
     
    has an init (constructor method) to create a BlockMeta object
        - most of the parameters are nil except the blockMetaID
        - sets self.variable = parameter for pretty much all variables EXCEPT the before/afterClassNotifications.
        - it automatically turns on before class notifications and turns off after class notifications. I mean think about it, the default notifications you see on your phone are '5 minutes until English' or something like that.
